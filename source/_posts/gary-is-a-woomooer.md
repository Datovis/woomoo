We got to know Gary when he was still an undergraduate student at Yuan Ze University. He was originally from Malaysia and came aboard to study Information System Technology and will join us as a front end developer. During his study, he was doing internship at WOOMOO and turned out to be a great talent due to the fact that he had worked as a freelancer for 4 years! We cannot wait but grab him right after he graduated. It took us a little work to get him work in Taiwan 'legally', but we managed to make it happen. 

He likes to play basketball and is interested in mysterious things. We will make sure he has a great time working with the big family.:)
