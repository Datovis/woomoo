**[POP: Turn Your Paper Mockups into Working Prototypes](http://theindustry.cc/2012/12/07/pop-turn-your-paper-mockups-into-working-prototypes/)**

CJ Melegrito has written a very detailed walkthrough oh how POP works on [The Industry](http://theindustry.cc/):

{% quote %}
POP- Prototyping on Paper- is a brilliantly, well-executed app, and its convention of solving the "idea-to-working-prototype" dilemma for iPhone apps is ingenious; and something that should have been done long ago.
{% endquote %}

And CJ mentioned an issue:

{% quote %}
I can't re-order anything. While I might take pictures of different app screens at a time, re-ordering or organizing them is virtually impossible; the same with projects.
{% endquote %}

You can actually re-order by tapping and holding the thumbnail for 1 second. We know it's not obvious at all, and plan to fix it in the next release.
