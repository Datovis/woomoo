Alli Dryer shares how to use POP.

{% quote %}
POP is a great tool because everything is happening at one to one scale: you sketch your ideas out at full size on a sketch pad, snap a photo with your phone, and then test your prototype in the exact setting in which your users will experience your app (the iPhone). Proper context gives you a clearer understanding of the experience you are creating and makes it easier to communicate it to others.
