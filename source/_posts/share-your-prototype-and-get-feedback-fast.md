We just released [POP iOS 1.7.0](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pop-prototyping-on-paper/id555647796?mt=8) today. Now POP is not only a prototyping tool, but also a collaboration service.

What do you do next when you finish your prototypes? You send it around to test and get feedback! So we started to focus on collaboration features since last update.

We made a [POP 1.7 prototype](http://popapp.in/w#!/projects/51fad1996630e3083900086c/preview) by POP itself. Come play with it and leave us some feedback via [web](http://popapp.in/w#!/projects/51fad1996630e3083900086c/mockups).

It also works for private projects. You can set it privately and [share to limited POP users](/blog/new-private-projects-and-in-app-sharing/) so they can play and leave comments .

Tip: there's a shortcut for easier comment while playing the prototype - just press the "volume up" button.
