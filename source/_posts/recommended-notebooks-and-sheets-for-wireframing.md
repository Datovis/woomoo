We're always looking for good notebooks and sketch papers to use with POP. Here are some recommendations.

- [MUJI Notebooks](http://www.muji.us/store/stationery/notebooks.html). For notebooks, we prefer those from Muji because they are minimal and looks great.
- [Mobile Sketch](http://sneakpeekit.com/mobile-sketchsheets/) Sheets from Sneakpeekit. You'll have to download the files and print yourself.
- [Interface Sketch](http://www.interfacesketch.com/): another option for print-outs.

Happy wireframing!
