Howard joins WOOMOO as an iOS developer to help Shao on the iOS team. With his experience of 5 years programming and worked in different startups and agencies, we are sure POP is going to be stronger!

Howard once swam across Sun Moon Lake which is the largest body of water in Taiwan (I think he was rescued by the lifeguards half way through but thatâ€™s pretend that never happened.^o^)
