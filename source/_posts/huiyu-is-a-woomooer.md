Huiyu is freshly onboard! Let's welcome her to join the design team as UI/UX designer!! She recently just completed her master degree at NTPU (one of the top interaction design focused universities in Taiwan) specializing in interactive media design. She will make sure that your experience of using POP gets better and better everytime.

She is a tech girl and has a tremendous passion for UX (what can I say? she really is one of us.) She loves animals and visits the zoo very very very often...and she also watches movies and read books at her free time.
