Do you always spend a lot of time extracting your PSDs into different formats for your prototypes? You don't have to anymore! With our Adobe integration, you can save your time on things that are more important.

You can now import all of your work directly from Adobe Creative Cloud into POP right after you're done with the design. More to offer, you can also download and import all the beatiful designs you find on Creative Market and apply to your projects!

##Extra bonus for iPad users
You can also choose to import an individual design layer from your PSD file into POP if necessary.
