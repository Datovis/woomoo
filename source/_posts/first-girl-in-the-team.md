As POP and the team grows bigger, we are delighted to have Lei Lei to join us as a community manager to build up a strong POP community. She has years of business development experience and loves to be surrounded by people with passion. She is also the first female in the team!

In her spare time, she does yoga and exercise a lot, drinks coffee, and eats like a real man!
