Just completed the master degree from NTU (the number one ranking school in taiwan), we are proud to have Ray to join the big family as a web backend developer. He started to code since 12 and is good at web frontend, backend, and iOS development.

Ray enjoys coding during his free time which is awesome!!!! When he is not coding, he sleeps.
