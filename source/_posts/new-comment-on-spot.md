#Getting feedback can never be easier!
We just launched a whole new commentting system to make communication easier and better than ever! 

Now you can discuss specific design between clients and the team without going through emails, just touch anywhere on the screen to leave a comment for easy communication.

##Only two steps for you to experiment!
1. Switch to comment mode on the top right in mockup view.

2. Tap anywhere on the screen to leave a comment.

Note:
- Comments will be ordered by the time the comment was made.
- Total comments made will appear on the top right of the mockup in project view.
- Total comments will appear in orange if you have unread comment.
