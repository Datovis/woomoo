In the upcoming version you can hide the status bar. To hide, simply press the "Volume Up" button while you're in Play Mode; to bring it back, press the button again. It's very useful if you're designing a full-screen app or apps in landscape mode.

(If you'd like to be asked whether to show status bar every time, you can do it in the settings screen.)
