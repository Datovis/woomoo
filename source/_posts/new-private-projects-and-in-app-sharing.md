POP 1.4 introduces two key features: private projects and in app sharing.

## Private Projects

Now if you create or share your prototype, you'll be able to set the project private. Only invited members can view your private projects; while public projects can be seen by anyone with the link. And you can switch between public and private anytime you want. Simply tap "share" icon and you'll see the option.

## More on Members

Also new in 1.4 is the ability to add members to a project. Members are certain people you want to share your prototypes with. It's worth noting that you can add members to a project whether it's public or private. Whenever you're sharing with your members, you can add a deliver message so your members know what's changed.

## In App Sharing

It's been requested many times and it's finally here: In App Sharing! Members with POP installed can now view shared prototypes directly on their iPhone, with full transition support!

Please update to the latest version and try the new features. Let us know what you think via Twitter, and feedback is always welcome.
