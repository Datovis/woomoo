We are very lucky to have Ding Yu Lin (a.k.a 200 because he is 200 cm tall) comes to join WOOMOO just in time to support our Windows development. He is also good at web frontend and backend development which means he will be the firefighter of the team!

200 is mysterious and doesn't like to show his face in public or to reveal his past. (this photo is the closest we can get!)

You can connect with him through [GitHub](https://github.com/pH-minamo) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pH_minamo).
