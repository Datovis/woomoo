This afternoon we received a package from Philadelphia, and it turned out to be a gift from [Chop Shop](http://chopshopstore.com/index.php/chopcards-mobile.html) called "Chop Cards Mobile".

It's a deck of cards with iPhone frames on them, a perfect match for POP!

We immediately made a prototype with Chop Cards + POP and it works great. What's really cool about Chop Cards is its size and texture.

Chop Cards have 1:1 accurate iPhone frame printed on them, and you can hold the card in one hand comfortably like holding an iPhone.

The texture of the card feels good and most importantly, they don't bend too easily like normal sketch papers. They do feel like "cards" instead of papers. Personally I've tried some iPhone sketch pads but didn't like them, because they often become scrambled after presentation. That's why I end up with notebooks right now. But after using Chop Cards, I really appreciate the benefit of cards. I can now arrange them at will. Easier to present, too. Very convenient.

If you're making iPhone prototypes with POP, do yourself a favor: buy a lot of Chop Cards. It's great and it's only $7.5. (And try the coupon code "popapp" and see if anything happens... no guarantee! :p)

Thank you, T.R. from Chop Shop!
