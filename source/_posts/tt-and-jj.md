Cats. Even though we got scratched every time when trying to grab them, were ignored most of the time when trying to please them, and were even allergic to their falling hair everywhere!! Still, it took us 0.1 second to make the decision of bringing them to the WOOMOO family.

TT- the thinner one, careless, playful, and energetic like a little boy.

JJ - the chubby one, sensitive and likes to whine about everything.

From this point forward, we, the WOOMOO team, offer you our vow to be your faithful partner in sickness and in health, in good times and in bad, and in joy as well as in sorrow. People who work at POP must share the responsibility of loving and taking care of them. After all, how wrong can a person be if he/she loves cat right?!

Here are some of the best shots.
